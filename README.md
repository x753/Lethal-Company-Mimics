# Mimics v2.2.1
### Adds a dangerous new monster to the game. Can you figure out what's real or will you be devoured?

## Information
Mimics always disguise themselves as one thing in particular. There are several strategies for distinguishing and surviving mimics, but you'll have to discover them for yourself.

## Configuration
Mimic spawn rate, volume, and difficulty can be modified through the config file generated after launching the mod at least once. This includes an easy mode (similar to earlier versions of the mod) and color blind mode.
