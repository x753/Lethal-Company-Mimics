# Mimics v2.0.0
### Adds a dangerous new monster to the game. Can you figure out what's real or will you be devoured?

## Information
Mimics always disguise themselves as one thing in particular. There are several strategies for distinguishing and surviving mimics, but you'll have to discover them for yourself.

## Configuration
Mimic spawn rate, volume, and difficulty can be modified through the config file generated after launching the mod at least once.

## Credits
